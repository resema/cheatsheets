# 5. Examples of software architecture
## 5.1. From requirements to solution (R3) :x:

> Software architects are expected to recognize and comprehend the correlation between requirements and constraints, and the chosen solutions using at least one example

---
## 5.2. Rationale of a technical implementation (R3) :x:

> Software architects understand the technical realization (implementation, techncial concepts, products used, architectural decisions, solution strategies) of a t least one solution
